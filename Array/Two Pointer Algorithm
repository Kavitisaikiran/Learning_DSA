When we have a sorted array to find the target value sum and index of those values we use this approach 

arr = [10,20,30,90,190]
Q: Find the indexes of values whose sum is 50

We initialize two pointers  left and right 
so 
l = 0
r = 0
while l<r:
if arr[l] + arr[r]:
  return (l,r)
elif arr[l] + arr[r] > target_sum:
  r = r-1
# here we are decreasing the right counter because the sum value is more so we need to move our search space to left 
else:
  l = l+1
# it covers the reverse approach of the elif loop

ans: (1,2)
