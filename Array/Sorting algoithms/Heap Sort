Heap Data structure comes into play , general tree structure especially : Complete Binary Tree
for a tree should be complete binary it can be either full binary tree or almost complete binary tree
for a tree to be Binary tree it should have the no of nods in (0,1,2)

heapq is the package used to import the heap sort package and by default it gets minHeap

Full Binary Tree:
                All nodes should be filled 
Almost complate Binary Tree:
                1.) Insertion of nodes should be from left to right 
                2.) All the parent nodes are filled first and then the children nodes  are filled 
Complete Binary Tree is super set of above trees

Here we genrally study two important concepts such as Min Heap and Max Heap 

Min Heap: it says parent node value is always less than the child node value 
Max Heap: Parent node value should be always greater than the child node value 

Insertion of element in Heap(min//max):

we generally visualize heap as array virtually 
Indexing of the values :
      1.)The parent node is always 0 by default (i)
      2.) for assaigning the left side element = 2(i) + 1  ::: where i is the index of its parent node 
      3.) for assigning the right side element = 2(i) - 1 
as  these Heap  structures as CBT (complete Bianry Tree)
number of nodes = 2^h - 1 ( h = heigth of the Tree)
number of leaf nodes = upper bound of [n/2]
height of the tree = log(n+1)
Time complexity here is O(log(n))


Deletion of Min Heap:

Note: The root node element is always deleted first and the last leaf node element  is placed at the root node
So by this,  it defies the min heap condition 
It is checked with its children nodes and replaced by min value in this way the swapping does
