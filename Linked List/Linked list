It is a linear Data Structure
Dynamic type Data Structure
 No Continues memory allocation
No random access is allowed 
Here we have Node
Node: 
    1.) We have Data 
    2.) Pointer which points to the address of another element // Node
Hear Node: It refers to the address of the first element node

We always do linear Searches on the Linked list to search for an element coz we can't randomly access elements Time Complexity === O(n)
Insertion and Deletion are best done in the linked list 

Types of Linked Lists:
    1.) Singular Linked list
    2.)Doubly Linked list
    3.) Circular Linked list

Doubly Linked list:
      Here we have 2 pointers one stores the address of the next node and other stores the address of previous node
      last node of the last element is always none 
Circular Linked list:
      Here is the doubly linked list concept is applied but there is change
      the last element next has the address of the first node and similarly the prev has the address of the last node in linked list
